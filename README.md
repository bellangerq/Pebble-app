# Quebble: One Motivational Quote Every Day

Because some days can be tough, [Quebble](http://quebble.io) sends you one motivational quote every day on your wrist. Get inspirational ideas and upgrade your mood with a simple quote. Be inspire and move forward!

Quotes are coming from « They said so » thanks to [their REST API](https://theysaidso.com/api/).

## How does it work

1. **Install the app on your watch**. You can find the app here: [Quebble on the Pebble Appstore](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/568057b24893f90bb2000098).
2. **Set your daily alarm time**. It allows you to choose when you want to receive your quote.
3. **That's it!** Your quote will be sent every day on your watch. Enjoy!

## The aim of the project

As I'm not a developer, **this project is a challenging way for me to improve my coding skills**. I'm also very interested in connected objects and that was a way to better know how it works.

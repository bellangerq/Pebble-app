# Quebble: One Motivational Quote Every Day

Because some days can be tough, [Quebble](http://quebble.io) sends you one motivational quote every day on your wrist. Get inspirational ideas and upgrade your mood with a simple quote. Be inspire and move forward!

> ⚠️ Since the end of December 2016, Pebble shut down their activity. Due to this big change, I stopped working on Quebble and assuring support.

## How does it work

1. **Install the app on your watch**. You can find the app here on the [Pebble Appstore](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/568057b24893f90bb2000098).
2. **Set your daily alarm time**. It allows you to choose when you want to receive your quote.
3. **That's it!** Your quote will be sent every day on your watch. Enjoy!

Quotes are coming from « They said so » thanks to [their REST API](https://theysaidso.com/api/).

## The aim of the project

As I was new to development, **this project was a challenging way for me to improve my coding skills**. I'm also very interested in connected objects and that was a way to better know how it works. You can learn more by reading the [story behind the project](https://medium.com/@Bellanger_q/i-created-my-first-pebble-watchapp-here-is-my-journey-c40bfa138e6a#.49ljldbmb).

# Quebble: one quote every day at your wrist

[Quebble](http://quebble.quentin-bellanger.fr) is a Pebble Classic and Pebble Time app. It's just a simple app that displays a  quote on your watch every day.

## How does it work

1. **Install the app on your watch**. You can find the app here: *[COMING SOON]*
2. **Set your daily alarm time**. It allows you to choose when you want to receive your quote.

It's fully coded using Javascript with **Pebble.js** because I don't know how to code in C (*the main language to create Pebble apps*) and because JS is a language that I'm currently learning.

# Quebble: one quote every day at your wrist

[Quebble](http://quebble.quentin-bellanger.fr) is a Pebble and Pebble Time watchapp. It's just a simple app that displays a  quote on your watch every day.

## How does it work

1. **Install the app on your watch**. You can find the app here: *[COMING SOON]*
2. **Set your daily alarm time**. It allows you to choose when you want to receive your quote.
3. **That's it!** Your quote will be sent every day on your watch. Enjoy!

## The aim of the project

As I'm not a developer, **this project is a challenging way for me to improve my coding skills**. I'm also very interested in connected objects and that was a way to know how it works.

It's fully coded using Javascript with **Pebble.js** because it's a language that I'm currently learning.
